 ⚙️ Features

- Hitscan shooting using raycasting  
- Client → Server validation  
- Fire rate control (cooldown system)  
- Basic recoil effect  
- Tool-based weapon system

 🧠 Technical Highlights

- Client-Server Separation  
  Input handled on client, validation and damage handled on server.

- Raycasting System
  Uses `workspace:Raycast()` for accurate hit detection.

- Modular Configuration 
  Weapon stats defined in a centralized config module.

- Scalable Architecture  
  Structured to easily support multiple weapons and attachments.

🛠️ Developer Notes

This system was built to simulate a simplified weapon framework similar to FPS-style systems.

The focus was on:
- Clean architecture
- Reliable client-server communication
- Expandability for future features (attachments, multiple weapons, etc.)
